# Audio Files Optimization

## Current Audio Files (Total: ~120MB)
The audio files in this directory are quite large and contribute significantly to the APK size.

## Optimization Options:

### Option 1: Compress Audio Files
- Convert MP3 files to lower bitrate (128kbps instead of 320kbps)
- Use shorter versions of tracks (30-60 seconds instead of full length)
- Consider using OGG format for better compression

### Option 2: Use Streaming
- Host audio files on a CDN
- Download audio files on-demand
- Cache downloaded files locally

### Option 3: Reduce Number of Files
- Keep only essential tracks
- Remove duplicate or similar tracks
- Use a smaller selection of high-quality tracks

## Recommended Action:
1. Compress all MP3 files to 128kbps
2. Create 30-second preview versions
3. Keep only 5-10 essential tracks
4. This should reduce audio size from ~120MB to ~20-30MB

## Tools for Compression:
- FFmpeg: `ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -b:a 128k output.mp3`
- Online tools: Audacity, Online Audio Converter
